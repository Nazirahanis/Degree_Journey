 We attend a PC Assembly class accompanied by our Techonoly, Information and System's lecturer, Dr Aryati on 30th October.
In session, we were split into a few groups before we learn about how to assemble and disassemble CPU components.
It was a valueable hands-on experience and oppurtuniy to see and handle the components physically, not just theoretically.
It enhanced my understandings and gave me a clear version of what we usually learn in lectures.
After the session, we also had a quiz to recap about what we learn during the assembly.
