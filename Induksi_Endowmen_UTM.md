# Induksi Endowmen UTM
- date : 21 November 2025
- venue : Dewan Sri Resak, KTDI

First and foremost, I would like to thank UTM Endowmen for giving me oppurtunity to be one of the candidates for UTM Endowmen Scholarship.
From this induction, I got more knowledge about UTM Endowmen and what should I prepare if I get the chance.
During this program, the panel will chose only a few candidate to be in the list of interview candidates. 
Fortunately, I got a chance to be the interview candidate on 8/12/2025. Another than aiming the scholarship, I could also interact with another candidates in group activities.

In conclusion, UTM Endowmen Induction is not only to aim the scholarship but also to build friendship, confidence, teamwork and more usefull skills. 

May I have an oppurtunity to get the scholarship too!
