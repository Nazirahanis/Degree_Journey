## 🔭 Overview of The Visit
An industry visit to Johor Corporation (JCORP) was conducted for students from section SECP1513-02. 

Johor Corporation (JCORP) is a state-owned investment holding company based in Menara KOMTAR, Ibrahim International Business District, Johor Bahru. Its flagship companies include Kulim (Malaysia) Berhad, KPJ Healthcare Berhad, QSR Brands (M) Holdings Bhd, and JLand Group Sdn Bhd. These companies operate across four key sectors, namely agribusiness, wellness and healthcare, food and restaurant services, and real estate and infrastructure.

During this particular visit, the focus was primarily on JCORP’s investments in artificial intelligence (AI), data architecture, and digital strategy.

A talk delivered by Encik Budiman Bujang provided an overview of the corporation and highlighted the application of AI within its services. In the organisation, AI is utilised not only to support operations but also as a strategic tool aimed at improving business performance.

Additionally, Encik Yusri Mohamed shared valuable guidance related to employability, including key qualities companies seek in prospective employees. He emphasised the importance of being knowledgeable and aware of advanced technological tools such as AI. He further noted that self-directed learning and a willingness to acquire new skills are essential attributes, as companies expect employees to continuously grow and improve over time.

## 📖 Reflection
This visit broadened my perspective on the importance of acquiring skills related to advanced technologies, particularly AI, to enhance workplace efficiency and remain relevant in the job market. Moving forward, I should continuously develop myself through self-learning, such as exploring new tools or pursuing relevant professional certifications.
