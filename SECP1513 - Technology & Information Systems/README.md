## Course Reflection
This course is a Work-Based Learning (WBL) learning mode where it doesn't have final exam but rely on quizzes, tests, assignments and projects. The theories I learned in this course is crucial that it would be applied for hands-on activities, final year projects (FYP) and real-working application. This course also held industry talks which helped me understand  the job roles and markets, required skills and opportunities that are not covered in textbooks. Overall, this course improved my understanding in IT and technology and also inspired me to focus on enhancing knowlegdes and skill-building, along with real-world application.
