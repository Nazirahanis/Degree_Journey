As a fundamental subject, this course equips the students with theory and practice on
problem solving techniques by using the structured approach. The course covers the
following: preprocessor directives, constants and variables, data types, input and output
statements, control structures: sequential, selection and loop, built-in and user-defined
functions, single and two dimensional arrays, file operations, pointers, and structured data
types. Students are required to develop programs using C++ programming language, in
order to solve simple to moderate problems. A learning approach that combines lectures,
lab exercises, and assignments strengthens both conceptual understanding and practical
programming skills. Students will be able to apply systematic problem-solving methods to
analyze and address programming challenges. Develop structured approach C++ programs
to solve problems of varying complexity within a specified time frame
