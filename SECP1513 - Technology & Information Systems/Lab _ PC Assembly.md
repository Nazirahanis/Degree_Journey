# Lab 1 : PC Assembly Class

**🕐 Date:** 30 October 2025 <br>
**🗓️ Time:** 4:00pm - 5:00pm

## 🔭 Overview
PC Assembly class was a part of the course learning, Technology, Information and System (TIS) 
In this session, students were split into a few groups before the briefing about how to assemble and disassemble CPU components. 
The session was conducted by a few staffs. After the session, we also had a quiz to recap about what we learn during the assembly.

### 🔑 Activities
- Observing the staff’s demonstration of CPU assembly and disassembly.
- Handling and installing components safely and accurately 
- Reassembling the PC and ensuring it boots successfully
- Completing a quiz of the understanding based on the earlier session

## 📝 Reflection
For me, it was a valuable hands-on experience and opportunity to see and handle the components physically, not just theoretically. 
It enhanced my understandings and gave me a clear version of what we usually learn in lectures. 

## Suggestion of Improvement
- Add a troubleshooting segment to give more real-world experience and strengthen the problem-solving skills.
