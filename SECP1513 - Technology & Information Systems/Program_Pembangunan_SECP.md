Today, I attended a programme held by my faculty, Program Pembangunan Pelajar SECP 2025, which was specially organized for Data Engineering students. The programme aimed to help students, especially first-year students, understand that our course isn’t just about theory, it’s also very practical and technical.

It reminded us how important it is to develop other skills beyond what we learn in class, such as communication and leadership. The programme also encouraged us to grab every opportunity and explore more about today’s world of technology, as computer science is a field that’s highly in demand yet very competitive.

It was a really insightful session, and I learned a lot about the skills and mindset needed to prepare for the future. Big thanks to my faculty and the organizing committee for arranging this programme!
