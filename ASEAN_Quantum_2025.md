# ASEAN QUANTUM SUMMIT 2025 

🗓️ 11 December 2025 
⏰ 2 pm until 5 pm
📍 Dewan Sultan Iskandar, UTM


I had an opportunity to attend ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 that was held in UTM itself.
This is the first ASEAN Quantum Summit supported by all ten ASEAN member countries. 
The event is organised to increase public awareness about quantum technology, start building a quantum ecosystem in the region
and encourage collaboration among researchers and innovators.

In my opinion, as a student who is taking computer science, 
this talk is a good chance for me to learn about quantum technology.


✨ Self-Reflection 
The initiative to hold the talk in a university, especially UTM is a thoughtful approach to region spread and teach students, lecturers and staffs. 
Therefore, this quantum technology will be more widely developed in our country as well as in the Southeast Asian.
