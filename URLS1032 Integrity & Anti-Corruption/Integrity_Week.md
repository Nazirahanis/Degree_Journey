# Integrity Week ULRS1032

🗓️ 10 December 2025

⏰ 2.00 pm - 5.00 pm

📍 Lecture Hall 7, N24

I attended talks for Integrity Week under the course Integrity and Anti-Corruption (ULRS1032). This talk was held at Lecture Hall 7, N24, from 2 pm until 5 pm.

The first talk was delivered by:
🗣️ Puan Raihan binti Abd Karim, Pegawai Takbir JTNCHEP UTM.

Her talk focused on integrity, especially among students. 
For example, she explained what UTM students should and shouldn’t do, how to report and to whom we should report if there is any case involving integrity among us.
We also had a quiz session, and the top 5 participants received prizes.


The second talk was delivered by:
🗣️ PPs Khailed bin Abdul Mobin, Pegawai SPRM Cawangan Pendidikan Masyarakat SPRM Johor.

His talk focused on corruption and the background, structure, and operations of SPRM. 
I learned that SPRM is not only involved in investigations but also focuses on educating the community.

We also had a Q&A session where students could ask questions about SPRM or corruption.

✨ Personal Reflection
I personally believe that this talk was not only to complete the credit hours for our course but also one of the initiatives to enhance the value of integrity and anti-corruption in every student. This talk should be held again to continually remind and educate students about integrity and anti-corruption.
