Program Jalinan Mesra 2025 (JLM’25)

🗓️ 20 December 2025 <br>
🕒 7.30 a.m. – 12.30 p.m. <br>
📍 Dataran Tasik Ilmu, UTM <br>

On 20 December 2025, UTM’s Sekreteriat Rakan Muda (SRM) organised Program Jalinan Mesra 2025 (JLM’25) for all SRM members.

In this programme, I had the opportunity to serve as a committee member under the Sponsorship Unit. This role was a new experience for me as it allowed me to gain exposure to various responsibilities and skills related to sponsorship management.

Prior to the programme, the Sponsorship Unit was tasked with securing sponsorships to support programme expenses. Through this process, I learned how to approach companies professionally, draft formal emails, and prepare a sponsorship prospectus. As a result of our collective efforts, we successfully obtained sponsorships from several companies.

During the event day, the Sponsorship Unit also supported other units to ensure the programme ran smoothly. We assisted the Activity Unit during the explorace session and supported the Registration and Food Unit in distributing meals and beverages to committee members and participants.

✨ Reflection <br>

Through this programme, I gained valuable knowledge, insights, and skills especially in communication, external liaison, and teamwork. Working with companies to secure sponsorship strengthened my professional communication skills, while collaborating with other units enhanced my coordination and teamwork abilities.

Overall, JLM’25 was a meaningful experience that contributed significantly to my personal development. I would like to express my appreciation to all SRM members for their commitment and cooperation throughout the programme.
