## Course Reflection
In this course, I got knowledges about principles and applications of discrete structure in the field of computer science. It gave me better understanding how these the mathematical concepts apply to real-world computing problems, including algorithms and data structures. One of the most useful aspects of this course was learning logical thinking and proof techniques. These skills helped me improve my ability to analyze problems step by step and justify solutions clearly.
