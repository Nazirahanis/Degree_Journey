## Course Reflection
This course introduced me to the principles of digital electronics as the basis for 
microprocessor-based systems in computers, robots, automobiles and industrial control applications. The teaching and learning are carried out through lectures and hands-on labs with Deeds Software. These helps me to emphasize problem-solving and practical application to enhance solutions for practical problems.
