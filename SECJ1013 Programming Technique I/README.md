## Course Reflection
This course taught me about fundamental theory and practice on problem solving techniques by using coding and programming, C++.
From this course, I learned to solve a problem using programming approach by developing structured C++ programs. I need to know the problem and plan the solution. With this, i could apply systematic problem-solving methods to analyze and address programming challenges.
