# PPG Industrial Talk 1
- Date : 20 November 2025, Thursday
- Venue : Hyflex Class N28A

Today, I attended a career/industrial talk from PPG. It was a talk handled by our TIS subject for all science computer students.
But for SECPH student, we got an oppurtunity to attend the physical talk in Hyflex classroom. 
The talk mainly focus on 4 topics :
1. Introduction to PPG
2. Data Analytics
3. Global Infrastructure
4. Introduction of SAP

After the talk, we were assigned to design a poster based on the talk for our second assigment and must be submitted in a week.

Self Reflection :
From this talk, I realised that ICT is not only to have the knowledges and the skills but to solve a problem and make sure that the company can work and maintain efficiently, securely and competitively. It motivated me to enhance my abilities so that I can give benefits to world.
