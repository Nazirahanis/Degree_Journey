# SPONSORSHIP UNIT FOR SRM JLM'25

I was offered to be one of sponsoship unit for one of Sekretariat Rakan Muda(SRM)'s programmes, which is Program Jalinan Mesra 2025, JLM' 25
For the first task I was required to list down a few possible walk-in sponsorship companies and created CPW to be sent to the company via email and WhatsApp.
Then for the second task, me and my another team member had to walk-in from a shop to another shop to approach and find a sponsorship. 
We managed to get sponsors from a few shops in term of money amd goods.
Our programme will be held on 20 December 2025 at Tasik Ilmu, UTM. 

Personally, becoming a sponsorship member is a new experience and a good opportunity to me because I get to learn how to get a sponsorship for a programme
and how to approach a company properly. It can also enhance my communication skills as I got to speak to the owner or the manager of the companies/franchises/shops.
