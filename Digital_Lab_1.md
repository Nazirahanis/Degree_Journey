# Digital Logic Lab
- Title : Lab 1 Combitional LOgic Circuit
- Date : 18 NOvember 2025
- Place : Digital Lab 328-02 N28

For Digital Logic class, we have our first lab where we have to build a circuit using AND, NOT and OR gates. This lab is also apart of our assestment where we practise what we theoritically learn in class. It is a good first insight on how complex circuit works. Thankyou to our lecturer, Encik Ahmad Fariz for this oppurtunity.
